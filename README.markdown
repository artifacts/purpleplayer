* What is Purple?

With Purple, you will create beautiful HTML5 animations with ease. Purple animations can be viewed on mobile devices and on your Desktop.

This is the PurplePlayer, a Javascript engine to play purple animations. Although animations are CSS3, some JavaScript is needed to
manage preloading, mulitple scenes (clips) and transitions. Also, the player will support timer-based animations for browsers like IE.

*What browsers does Purple support?

Purple supports webkit-compatible browsers, such as Safari browser, mobile Safari or Google Chrome browser. We are using newest CSS extensions like keyframes, which are not available on every browser. We want to deliver smooth animations and the best way to accomplish this is to use -webkit CSS extensions. Firefox 5 might follow soon, since it supports keyframes now.

*Will Internet Explorer ever be supported?
Even Internet Explorer 10 has no support for keyframe animations. Emulating this is certainly possible and done in other players, but our focus lies on delivering best mobile experience.
If you feel like something is missing (like IE or Opera support), and you want to contribute don't hesitate and send us a patch or contact us!
